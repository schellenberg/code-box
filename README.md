# code-box
Gives students a place to write code, then copy/paste it into your LMS for quiz/exam questions.
The webpage will just be a full page textbox, using a locally downloaded version of CodeMirror so that it can work anywhere (with or without internet access).
The textbox should include the following:
- monospace font
- tab for indentation
- shift-tab for unindentation
- no autocomplete
- no syntax highlighting
There should also be a "Copy Code" button that selects all the code in the textbox and copies it to the clipboard to make pasting it into the LMS easy.
